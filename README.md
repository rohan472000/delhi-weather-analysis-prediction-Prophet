# Delhi Weather Analysis and Prediction using Prophet
This project aims to analyze and predict the weather in Delhi, India using the Facebook Prophet forecasting model. The project is implemented in Python, and the code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.

## Description
The Jupyter Notebook file contains the following sections:

- Data Collection: This section describes how the weather data for Delhi was collected. It may include details on the data source, data format, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data.

- Data Analysis: This section provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the weather data for Delhi. It may include visualizations, statistical analysis, and other insights obtained from the data.

- Data Preprocessing: This section covers any preprocessing steps applied to the data before feeding it into the Prophet model. It may include handling missing values, data normalization, feature engineering, and other data preparation techniques.

- Model Training: This section describes how the Prophet forecasting model was trained using the preprocessed data. It may include details on model configuration, parameter tuning, and model evaluation.

- Model Evaluation: This section provides an evaluation of the trained Prophet model's performance. It may include metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and other relevant performance indicators.

- Weather Prediction: This section demonstrates how the trained Prophet model can be used for weather prediction in Delhi. It may include visualizations of the predicted weather trends, forecasts, and uncertainty intervals.

- Conclusion: This section summarizes the findings and conclusions of the project, including any insights gained from the data analysis and model predictions. It may also mention any limitations or areas for future improvement.
